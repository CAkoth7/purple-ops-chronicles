# About

I am a cybersecurity and GRC professional with over four years of experience working in highly regulated banking environments. My work focuses on identity and access management, cloud security, cyber risk governance, and the responsible adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning within security programs.

I have led and contributed to initiatives spanning IAM strategy development, privileged access governance, vulnerability and risk assessments, third-party security compliance, and ISO 27001–aligned policy and control implementation. My approach combines analytical rigor with practical execution—treating cybersecurity not only as a technical function, but as an enterprise risk management discipline.

Alongside professional practice, I work on applied research and self-directed projects in predictive modelling, anomaly detection, and AI risk assessment I also mentor emerging cybersecurity professionals, supporting the development of risk-aware thinking and industry-relevant skills.

PurpleOps Chronicles serves as a professional knowledge base and reflective space, sharing frameworks, lessons learned, and practical insights for security practitioners, risk professionals, and organisations navigating cloud transformation, AI adoption, and regulatory complexity.
