# Research & Projects

This section documents selected **research, simulations, and practical security work** focused on governance, identity, cloud risk, and applied analytics.

The work here prioritises:
- clarity over complexity
- governance impact over tooling
- repeatable patterns over one-off fixes

---

## Identity & Access Management

### Risk-Based IAM Governance Framework (Simulation)
**Focus:** IAM, GRC, ISO 27001, NIST

Designed a simulated enterprise IAM governance framework aligned with ISO 27001:2022 and NIST standards.  
The framework models identity lifecycle risk across joiner–mover–leaver events and integrates segregation of duties checks, access reviews, and continuous monitoring.

**Key outcomes**
- Formal IAM risk statements mapped to business roles
- Governance-driven access design
- Metrics for privilege creep and access persistence

## Cloud & AI Risk

### Machine Learning–Based Threat Detection Model
**Focus:** ML, anomaly detection, security analytics

Developed a threat detection model using Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms on simulated security event data.

**Highlights**
- Feature engineering on diverse needs
- Improved alert prioritisation
- Demonstrated limits of ML without governance context

---

## Governance & Compliance

### Enterprise AI Risk Assessment (Team Exercise)
**Focus:** AI governance, regulatory alignment

Led a team based AI risk assessment to evaluate organisational readiness for AI adoption, identifying data governance, auditability, and decision transparency gaps.

**Deliverables**
- Risk taxonomy
- Control recommendations
- Alignment with regulatory expectations
