# PurpleOps Chronicles

Cybersecurity is not only about controls and tooling, it is about judgment, governance, and operational reality.

PurpleOps Chronicles explores identity, risk, cloud security, and AI governance within regulated and high-impact environments. The focus is on how security decisions are made, implemented, and sustained over time.

This space documents practical thinking at the intersection of:
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Cyber risk and governance (GRC)
- Cloud security and zero trust architecture
- AI and machine learning risk management

The aim is to bridge the gap between compliance requirements, technical controls, and real organisational decision-making.
