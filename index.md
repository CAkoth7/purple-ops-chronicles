# PurpleOps Chronicles

*A practitioner's notebook on identity, risk, and governance in complex systems.*

### What this site explores

This space examines how security failures emerge **not from missing tools**, but from **misaligned governance, degraded controls, and quiet risk accumulation** particularly across on-premise, cloud platforms.
